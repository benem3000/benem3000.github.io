					<p>We want to build THE church, not OUR church</p>

					<p>Many people ask us what does the Resort mean. The name &ldquo;THE RESORT&rdquo; was chosen to describe the lifestyle of a Christian who is constantly living in daily relationship with Jesus. Jesus Christ is our Resort, or as the bible describes in Psalm 91, he is our refuge. When you make Jesus Christ the Resort of your life, you begin to experience his refreshing and rest, no matter what your circumstances. The Resort as a church is dedicated to teaching and building Christians to become aware of the fact that they are SONS and DAUGHTERS of God. With this privilege of being Gods children we have received an inheritance and are heirs of the Kingdom through his son Jesus Christ.</p>

					<p> </p>

					<p>This Kingdom includes experiencing not just the love of God but also the POWER of God, in our daily lives. The Resort originally started as a dream that God put inside of the heart of our head Pastor Andrew Segura. After living in the Philippines, Andrew returned home to Fresno, CA. with a burning desire to see the kingdom of God spread like wildfire here at home in the U.S. He desired to see a genuine, authentic, raw expression of Gods heart be released into the Earth. The steps were set in place to form a non-profit Ministry called ASM which stood for Andrew Segura Ministries. On January 12th, 2016 the State of California recognized ASM as an official incorporated Non-Profit. The Dream had begun.  </p>

					<p>The first meetings of ASM began as bible studies held on Thursday nights in the homes of friends. The meetings began growing so rapidly that the Ministry changed three locations in four months as the number of people outgrew each home. It was at this time that God led ASM to host their meetings at the Falls Event Center In Fresno, ca. After one year a team of volunteers had gathered around Andrew and then God spoke that ASM would change its name to &ldquo;The Resort&rdquo;.</p>

					<p> </p>

					<p>Yet Andrew and the team desired that the Resort wouldn&rsquo;t just be another church. They began speaking the phrase, &ldquo;We want to build THE church, not OUR church.&rdquo; The aim was Keeping the heart and vision focused on building the KINGDOM OF GOD instead of any location, with a heavy emphasis on evangelism and the KINGDOM MINDSET and KINGDOM PRINCIPLES expanding beyond the four walls. Another foundation was the belief that God is not trying to get something TO us, but to do something THROUGH us, and that every person associated with the ministry is an ACTIVE PARTICIPANT in what God is doing in their daily life.</p>

							<p>We believe the one and only begotten Son of God (John 3:16) is the Lord Jesus Christ. He was born of the virgin, Mary, and conceived of the Holy Spirit. He is fully God and fully man. He is the prophesied Messiah, the one who saves the world from their sins. He lived a sinless life and was sent to the Earth to establish the Kingdom of God, destroy the works of the devil, and bring salvation to all people. He was crucified on a cross for our sins, died, was buried, and rose from the dead on the third day. Through this resurrection, he gained authority over death, hell, and the grave. After this he ascended into heaven, where he is now seated at the right hand of the throne of God. In John 14:6 Jesus said, &ldquo;I am the way, the truth, and the life. No one comes to the Father except through me.&rdquo;</p>

							<p>In the book of genesis, God originally created man to walk in perfect relationship with him. The first man was named Adam, and was created in Gods image, without sin to separate him from knowing and enjoying God. In Genesis chapter three, Adam and his wife sinned against god, and willingly and knowingly fell from their created intention. Because of this all of humankind and creation experience the negative consequences of sin, including sickness and disease, guilt, shame, death, and judgement. Salvation</p>

							<p>Salvation is the gift of God&rsquo;s Grace, and only occurs through faith in the work of Jesus Christ on the cross. It is available to anyone who repents of their sins, and decides to confess with their mouth and believe in their heart that Jesus Christ is their Savior and Lord.   </p>

							<p>The holy spirit is God and regenerates the life of a Christian. He acts as our guide, friend, teacher, comforter, helper, seal of promise, counselor, and advocate. Jesus said the Holy Spirit is the revealer of all truth. He is also the source of conviction in a Christian&rsquo;s life.</p>
							<p>At conversion God seals every believer with the Holy Spirit, who now guides that believer&rsquo;s life through the process of Sanctification. The baptism of the Holy Spirit as described in the book of acts, is still poured out on believers to empower them to act as witnesses. The power of the Holy Spirit living inside of a Christian, gives us the ability to live a holy and supernatural life and minister with all gifts of the Holy spirit in operation.</p>

The Church is composed of people who have confessed by faith to be followers of Jesus Christ and his gospel. The Church is Gods governing body and the extension of his heavenly kingdom on Earth. The Church exists to worship and glorify God as Father, Son and Holy Spirit. The duty of the church is to advance the kingdom of God on Earth. This is done through making disciples, preaching and teaching the word of God and the good news of the gospel, exercising authority over the powers of hell, demonstration of the love and power of god, baptism, communion, church planting, and evangelism.</p>

Heaven and hell both exist and are physical places and there will be a future physical resurrection of the dead. Only those who turn from sin and to Jesus in faith and repentance will be raised to eternal reward. Those who do not turn from sin and to Jesus will be raised to eternal punishment. The final judgment will determine the eternal status of both the believers and the unbelievers, determined by their relationship to Jesus Christ. We affirm with the Bible the final state of the new heavens and the new earth.</p>
